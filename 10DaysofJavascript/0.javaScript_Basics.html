    <h1>JavaScript Basics:</h1>
    <p> 
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Lexical Structure</h2>
            <p>Lexical is relating to the words or vocabulary of a language. The lexical structure of a programming language 
                is the set of elementary rules that tells you how to write programs in that language. It's essentially the 
                lowest-level syntax of a language and specifies such things as what variable names look like, the delimiter 
                characters for comments, and how one program statement is separated from the next.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Character Set:</h2>
            <p>JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1. <br>
                JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. <br>
                JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs. For the most part, JavaScript also ignores line breaks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Printing Output:</h2>
            <p>We use the console.log method to write data to standard output in JavaScript.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Literals:</h2>
            <p>A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program. For example: <br>
                <pre>
                    // The integer number twelve:
                    12 
                    // The floating-point number one-point-two:
                    1.2 
                    // A string of text:
                    "Hello, World." 
                    // Another string:
                    'Hi!' 
                    // A boolean value:
                    true 
                    // The absence of an object:
                    null 
                    
                    More complex expressions can serve as array and object literals.
                    // An object initializer: "{}"
                    {x: 1, y: 2} 
                    // An array initializer: "[]"
                    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
                </pre>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Identifiers:</h2>
            <p>An identifier is simply a name that you can specify and use as a means of referring back to a specific value or 
                other piece of code. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables and functions, as well as to provide 
                labels for certain code loops.A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar 
                sign ($). Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, dollar signs, or digits (i.e., the numbers 0 through 9). 
                Like many other languages, JavaScript doesn't allow digits as the first character of an identifier because it makes 
                them more easily distinguishable from numbers.
                <pre>
                    Some valid identifiers are:
                    x
                    variable_name
                    sum13
                    _variable
                    $variable
                </pre>
               A number of identifiers are reserved words or keywords, meaning they are part of a set of predefined words that 
               have special meaning in the language itself. You cannot use these words as identifiers in your programs. 
               For example, for and function are reserved words in JavaScript. In addition, there are a number of predefined 
               global variables and functions; it's important to avoid using these predefined names for your own variables 
               and functions.
   </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Optional Semicolon:</h2>
            <p>Like many programming languages, JavaScript uses the semicolon (;) to separate statements from each other. 
                This is important as it makes the meaning of your code clear; without a separator, the end of one statement 
                might appear to be the beginning of the next (and vice versa). In JavaScript, you can usually omit the 
                semicolon between two statements as long as those statements are written on separate lines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Data Types:</h2>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types: <br>
                A primitive value or data type is data that is not an object and has no methods. All primitives are immutable, 
                meaning they cannot be changed. There are six primitive types: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Number</h3>
                    <p>According to the ECMAScript standard, all numbers are double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 
                        754-2008, meaning there is no specific type for integers. <br>
                        <ul class="makeItbold">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Maximum Value for a Number</h4>
                                <p>The MAX_VALUE property has a value of approximately 1.7976931348623157x10^308; 
                                    Values larger than Number.MAX_VALUE are represented as Infinity.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Minimum Value for a Number</h4>
                                <p>The MIN_VALUE property is the smallest positive value of the Number type closest to 0, 
                                    not the most negative number, that JavaScript can represent. MIN_VALUE has a value of 
                                    approximately 5x10^-324; Values smaller than Number.MIN_VALUE ("underflow values") 
                                    are converted to 0.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Symbolic Numbers</h4>
                                <p>There are three symbolic number values:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Infinity: This is any number divided by "0", or an attempt to multiply 
                                            Number.MAX_VALUE by an integer ">1";
                                        </li>
                                        <li>-Infinity: This is any number divided by "-0", or an attempt to multiply 
                                            Number.MAX_VALUE by an integer "<-1";
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            NaN: This stands for "Not-a-Number" and denotes an unrepresentable value (i.e.,root(-1)).
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
